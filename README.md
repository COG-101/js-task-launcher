# JS Task Launcher

Two JavaScript programs created as part of a software development course, connected via a single page:

The former is a simple function looping though a series of values declaring them either odd or even.
The latter, a program designed to take user input and run a stock check, appending the item should it be out of stock and the user wishing to order it.
